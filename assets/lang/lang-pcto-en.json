  "pcto_intro_para1": "Last year I had the opportunity to join the team at SYEEW S.r.l., a young company developing a SaaS Business Intelligence platform for micro and small businesses. The goal? Make business numbers as clear as traffic lights: green when everythingâ€™s running smoothly, red when action is needed.",
  "pcto_intro_para2": "The team was small, which allowed me to work closely with everyone, understand different priorities, and actively contribute. There was no dedicated UX department, so I worked independently while regularly consulting with the CEO and my technical tutor.",

  "about_syeew_para1": "Founded in 2020, SYEEW is an innovative startup based in Jesi, aiming to revolutionize how micro and small businesses interpret their business data. Its goal is simple but ambitious: make numbers instantly understandable through a visual interface using Business Emojis to represent financial and operational performance.",
  "about_syeew_para2": "Behind the apparent simplicity lies a sophisticated technology that combines data integration, automation, and AI modules. The platform collects data from various sources, normalizes it, processes it, and returns it in an immediate and intuitive format, allowing even those without analytical skills to make informed decisions.",
  "about_syeew_para3": "In 2022, SYEEW received public funding of â‚¬100,000, covering 70% of a development project officially registered in the National Transparency Register. A concrete acknowledgment of the innovative value the company brings to the Italian SME landscape.",

  "modalita_indaffarato_title": "BUSY",
  "modalita_indaffarato_desc": "This mode gives you an immediate idea of how your business is performing, without needing to spend time analyzing. Thanks to four business emojis, you can instantly interpret the overall status: positive, negative, stable, or worth monitoring. Itâ€™s a visual, instinctive tool designed for those with little time who still want to stay updated.",

  "modalita_curioso_title": "CURIOUS",
  "modalita_curioso_desc": "With Curious, you can go a bit beyond visual intuition and explore daily revenue details, comparing them to a selected period. In just a few clicks, you get a clearer view of your daily performance: how much you're selling, how your business is evolving day by day. It's a lightweight but informative mode, perfect for gaining present-day awareness.",

  "modalita_minuzioso_title": "DETAILED",
  "modalita_minuzioso_desc": "This mode opens up a complete analysis, item by item, with exact numbers and direct comparisons.

Ideal for those who want to dive into details and optimize every aspect.",

  "emoji_sirena_title": "The Mermaid",
  "emoji_sirena_desc": "The Mermaid always swims, even against the current. You're doing well, but beware: something's not quite right. While some indicators are positive, efficiency or average price may have dropped compared to the previous period. Itâ€™s time to dive deeper into the data to identify the area needing improvement.",

  "emoji_spia_title": "The Spy",
  "emoji_spia_desc": "Nothing escapes the Spyâ€™s magnifying glass. It's here to alert you to hidden pitfalls.

  "tool_vscode_title": "Visual Studio Code",
  "tool_vscode_desc": "Main editor for Flutter development. Configured with Dart and Flutter extensions for full language support, integrated debugging, and hot reload. The environment allowed me to quickly test changes on a physical device via USB debugging.",

  "experience_period3_para1": "On this date, I joined SYEEW as a guest at SMAU Milan, one of the most important Italian events for innovation, startups, and digital transformation. Although we didnâ€™t have a booth, we actively experienced the day, exploring the venue, listening to pitches, and networking with professionals.",
  "experience_period3_para2": "I attended presentations and discussions that introduced me to many emerging realities. It was enlightening to observe how companies communicate their values, missions, and results: some through data, others with emotional storytelling, and others with a focus on social impact.",

  "review_section_sub_title": "Reflection",
  "review_section_main_title": "What I take with me",
  "review_para1": "The experience at SYEEW gave me a concrete taste of how a digital product is born: from a blank page to a working demo. I appreciated the trust and freedom to experiment. At the same time, I experienced the fast pace of startups firsthand: some tasks, like API integration or usability testing, were left out due to time constraints.",
  "review_para2": "One of the things that impressed me most was the CEOâ€™s complete dedication to the project: every detail, screen, and strategy was handled with daily passion and care. It made me think about how fulfilling it must be to build something from scratch, see it grow, and improve it consistently. Itâ€™s an approach I dream of adopting myself one dayâ€”perhaps for my own project.",
  "review_thanks_lead": "I want to sincerely thank every team member who made this experience possible. Thank you for your time, precise suggestions, life advice, ongoing feedback, and every single exchange of ideas.",
  "review_thanks_para": "This experience also helped me clarify my future path: I realized I want to continue my studies in Interaction Design. It was here that I first began to think more deeply about how people interact with digital interfacesâ€”starting with the first assignmentâ€”and Iâ€™ve been fascinated ever since.",
